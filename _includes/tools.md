### Tools

The following categories of tools for website development are discussed.

URL shortening: bit.ly  
Code editors: Visual Studio Code for react.js code. Atom is also an option but with less functionality.  
Image processing: GIMP  
Audio processing: Audacity  
Video processing: DaVinci Resolve  
Browser: Firefox with its developer support (Chrome is too resource intensive, and Safari ecosystem of extensions is limited and not free)  
Hosting: Google Cloud - it's easy to use and one of the cheapest options  
Coding language: react.js is based on node.js with all the associated benefits of server-side rendering (SSR). It is also part of an ecosystem of web UI component suppliers. It strikes a good balance between prebuilt components (typical of static content tools) and a powerful dynamic content language.

      - architecture usage - how components are used (struct, content)
      - sidebar menu component name - how used
      - responsive web design, devices
   - git and github (for source control)
      - list repos (we're focusing on react.js for website dev)
   - hosting options
      - github vs google cloud
   - combining git and npm architectures
      - workspace level (-wspace) - have .git and .gitignore
      - webapp level (NPM start)
   - git commands (appendix?)
