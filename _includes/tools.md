### Tools

The following categories of tools for website development are discussed.

URL shortening: bit.ly 

Code editors: Visual Studio Code for react.js code. Atom is also an option but with less functionality.

Image processing: GIMP

Audio processing: Audacity

Video processing: DaVinci Resolve

Browser: Firefox with its developer support (Chrome is too resource intensive, and Safari ecosystem of extensions is limited and not free)

Hosting: Google Cloud - it's easy to use and one of the cheapest options 

Coding language: react.js  
React.js is based on node.js with all the associated benefits of server-side rendering (SSR). It is also part of an ecosystem of web UI component suppliers. It strikes a good balance between prebuilt components (typical of static content tools) and a powerful dynamic content language. React.js components are used at two levels: to create web page structure (structural components) and for content (content components). An external sidebar menu component is used to select the content that is display in a vertically scrollable content pane characteristic of a single page application (SPA). The responsive web design (RWD) principle is adhered to in a way that targets the standard laptop screen size. Rendering on a mobile device is possible but not optimal.

Source control and backup storage: The git and github (industry standard) - http://github.com/johnoos/react.js-wspace

   - hosting options
      - github vs google cloud
   - combining git and npm architectures
      - workspace level (-wspace) - have .git and .gitignore
      - webapp level (NPM start)
   - git commands (appendix?)
