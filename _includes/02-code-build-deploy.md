## Coding
The Visual Studio Code Interactive Development Environment (IDE). 
The folder at the WORKSPACE level should be opend in the IDE for the built-in git support to work properly. I normally  
Alternatively, git can be used with a command line interface (CLI). I prefer to use the git command line commands, however.  

Before coding starts, the current working directory should be changed to the webapp folder, in this case, 'jo-music-theory'. 
This can be done either using the built-in command line tool, or a separate CLI window. 
Once in this folder, the command 'npm start' should be invoked to start the development node.js server and enable auto-deployment to it 
whenever any of the underlying files change through performing a 'save' in the IDE.
Appendix A below shows the required git commands. See Appendix B for more information on the npm commands.

## Building
- npm build (get more from w3schools npm tutorial)
   - creates a deployable file like a war file
   
## Deploying
- google cloud procedure / commands
   - picks up the deployable file and puts it in the cloud
   - get more from (console.?)cloud.google.com
